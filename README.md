For this competition, you will create an RL agent (or some other machine learning model if you so desire)
that will play the classic game of pong.

To do this you should fill out the classes in the `pong_player.py` file. 

Once you have filled out those two classes, you should create code to train your model.

Then you should make sure your training code does what you think it does.

Then you should train your model for a while with your training code, and save the output to file using the `PongPlayer.save` function.
Once you've trained it for a while you should check how its doing, by running `play_game`. If its not doing so well, you should double check that your model and training code do what they are supposed to, and then if those are correct perhaps change your model architecture, if its still doing poorly.

Note that I have left this particularly open ended compared to homeworks, because I think you can be really creative with your solutions.
I'm not requiring you to use RL, and I believe the winner of the solution will be a team that thinks outside the box.
